For this project there are some pre-requisites and steps which are---
[1] AWS EC2 Virtual Server
[2] Jenkins Server
[3] Git and Github
[4] Apache Maven
[5] Docker
[6] Ansible
[7] Kubernetes

[1]-------------------------------------------------AWS EC2 Virtual Server--------------------------------------------------------

 ![EC2](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/88c7018c-eb7c-4fb8-a19e-24f91433c036)
 Like above image, we have to create EC2 instances each one according to need.

[2]-------------------------------------------------Jenkins Server-----------------------------------------------------------------
 ![Jenkins-server](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/d1ab6c99-8839-4b58-9afe-1730b99022ce)
 Like above image, we have install Jenkins in one of our instances and we can do it using jenkins official site according to your linux flavour

[3]--------------------------------------------------Git and Github----------------------------------------------------------------
 ![Github-integration](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/f77bed2e-9fb9-4ad6-8d15-0a0e06c990d9)
 Like above image, we have to configure Github with Jenkins, so that it pulls codes from the our Github account.

[4]--------------------------------------------------Apache Maven------------------------------------------------------------------
 ![Maven-integration](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/d6e2093f-ae02-4749-aa96-373d310266b3)
 Like above image, we have to configure Maven with Jenkins

[5]----------------------------------------------------Docker-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  We are going to install docker in one of our instance and we are going to execute our Dockerfile for installing docker dependencies. (image attached below). 
  ![DockerImage](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/0a18d77c-e334-416a-8cad-80a5d0e80644)
  after executing the above Dockerfile we are going to run our ansible-playbook hello-app.yaml that will load our docker image from dockerhub
  hello-app.yaml---
  ![Docker-hello-app](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/d2dd0fd4-fae2-4039-b948-26e31e9e47d5)
  
[6]----------------------------------------------------Ansible----------------------------------------------------------------------
 By using SSH connection, we are going to automate our above docker task using ansible integration with Jenkins and SSH plugin 
 ![Ansible-integration](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/fd537f2d-b279-4db0-a6bc-43f597280946)
 We have created a Jenkins job to do the above task----
 ![Jenkins-job](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/d8999b2e-548c-40ed-8aa0-a117e264dcf4)
 pull_code_github is the job that is used for automating the above task.
[7]-----------------------------------------------------Kubernetes------------------------------------------------------------------
 I have used EKS for Kubernetes but minikube-based Kubernetes in an EC2 instance also work the same.
 after setting up EKS, I have deployed a deployment called hello-app using kubernetes-hello-app.yml file and in this deployment we have used docker image build in docker section.
 and also binding that deployment to a service can be accessed easily. You can see the link generated by the service to access our docker image.
 ![lastpage](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/8227e262-bd59-44e8-ad3b-8d5761201400)

 Now after doing above steps, I have to automate above task using Ansible-play
 ![K8s-server](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/e98551d4-f4fc-4db1-beb5-06469f9ebb3a)
 and also integrate the task Jenkins so that everthing happens with one click, so this created one more job so that it will proceed after job of docker
 ![Jenkins-job](https://github.com/hijackhim/hello-CICD/assets/105789918/9bcee80e-6161-4917-9d05-83ceecf4f566)
 as you can see in above image, so I named it as CD_job, and it will only start after completion of creation docker build.

 and after successful execution of both Jenkins job and using external link from service created followd by 8080, we can access the application.
